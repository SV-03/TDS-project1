Austin Users and Repositories

The Python script scrapes GitHub user and repository data for users in Austin with over 100 followers, saving the information into CSV files, includeing functions for cleaning data, fetching user details, and managing pagination while adhering to API rate limits for efficient data retrieval.

Interesting findings: Many users work at major tech companies like Google and Microsoft, with 'getify' having the highest follower count; JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, and Go are the most preferred languages, and the highest repository creation year was 2016, with around 3,800 repositories.

Recommendation: Developers should focus on creating or contributing to repositories that emphasize collaborative features, as these are popular in Austin.
